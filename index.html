          <h2>Background Information</h2>
          <p><b>Hometown:</b> Coatzacoalcos</p>
          <p>I was born in Coatzacoalcos Mexico but have lived in Fruitland/Salisbury for 14 years. I already have an Associate of Applied Science: Computer & Network Support which I obtained at Wor-Wic.  I decided to major in Information Systems because I would like to have some sort of business degree under my belt.</p>

          <h2>My Life at SU</h2>
          <p><b>Year:</b> 2022</p>
          <p><b>Major:</b> Information Systems</p>
          <p><b>Where I live:</b> Off Campus</p>
          <p><b>Clubs/Activities:</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Not part of a Club</li>
            <li>Coding/Hardware Design</li>
            <li>Weightlifting</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            I presume that my experience is completely different than most SU students. I say this because I am 22, married, bought a house, help my father manage his comapany full-time all while being full-time student.  In addition, so far my experience at SU has been affected by COVID. I only had one non-COVID semester and it was by far the best one. Hopefully this semester

          <h2>My Goals for this Course</h2>

          <ol>
            <li>Learn more about JavaScript (I've been trying to avoid this language)</li>
            <li>Learn more about websites and their backends</li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            I would like to learn as much as possible to expand my knowledge in the tech and business field. In addition, I would like to use the knowledge that I gain in this class on other aspects of my life and the future.
